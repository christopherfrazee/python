In my attempt to refresh my skills in regards to high tech
I am generating everything in this directory purely as a
resource or of academic value to myself.

practice_snippets.py -  

is basically code snippets that I have created as a single
A quick refresh on commonly used logic or tasks done in 
applications (file io, regular expressions, socket IO, loops,
conditionals, numeric functions, manipulating lists and 
dictionary content.

pairs.py -

I created this as part of a online coding challenge site.
Can't remember which one.  Regardless, it was a interesting
challenge.  Sadly the next one in the challenge I thought
was a little too academic (good for application engineer)
but not devopsy type of person, so I stopped.

oo_stuff.py

By default my mind currently does not think in terms of 
"objects" but rather "scalars", so I chose this practice
purposely to exercise the use of the object oriented 
nature of Python.  Once I realized terraform is very object
oriented, I figured this would be a good practice to do.
